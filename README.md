USB 2.0 Device IP Core

Description

This is a USB 2.0 compliant core. USB 2.0 allows data transfers of 480 Mb/s. Because
of the high interface speed, an external PHY will be required with this core. A industry
standard PHY interface for USB has been developed. This interface is called USB Transceiver
Macrocell Interface or UTMI for short. The host interface of the USB core is WISHBONE
SoC compliant. More information about the USB standard and a full specification can be
found at www.usb.org More information about the WISHBONE SoC and a full specification can
be found on www.opencores.org. The UTMI specification (and various other useful USB papers)
can be downloaded from here:
